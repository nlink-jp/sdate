# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`make verify-release` now fails closed.** Its last block chained unzip, the
  packaged binary's `--version` and `spctl` with `&&` and ended the whole chain
  in `|| true`, so a zip that did not unpack or a binary that did not run exited
  0 and the upload proceeded. Each step is now judged on its own, the packaged
  binary's `--version` must contain the tag being released, and only the
  informational `spctl` line may be ignored. Matches the org template
  (CONVENTIONS.md §Code Signing → Verifying a release).
- **The Linux archives no longer carry macOS file metadata.** macOS `tar` wrote
  each bundled file's extended attributes (`com.apple.provenance`, and a Dropbox
  attribute where the tree is synced) into the `.tar.gz` twice: as AppleDouble
  `._` members, which GNU tar extracts as stray `._<name>` files beside the real
  ones, and as `LIBARCHIVE.xattr.*` / `SCHILY.xattr.*` pax headers, which it
  reports as unknown keywords. `make package` now archives with
  `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar --no-xattrs`; each setting stops one of the two.
  Archives already published still carry them; the files themselves are
  unaffected.

### Internal

- `make verify-release` also judges each Linux archive: no AppleDouble or other
  macOS metadata members — listed with `--options 'tar:!mac-ext'`, because a
  plain macOS listing folds `._` members away — no extended attributes as pax
  headers, and exactly the canonical binary, `README.md` and `LICENSE`, compared
  in the C locale.
- The Linux-archive check in `make verify-release` reads each archive's pax
  headers with Python's `tarfile` instead of grepping the decompressed stream,
  which also matched file text that names the keywords (a bundled CHANGELOG,
  for one).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-12

### Removed

- **darwin/amd64 (Intel) pre-built binary.** macOS releases now ship
  **arm64 only**, per the org-wide policy (darwin is Apple-Silicon only; no
  universal binaries). Intel Mac users can build from source.

### Changed

- **Linux release archives are now `.tar.gz`** (darwin/windows remain `.zip`),
  per `nlink-jp/.github` CONVENTIONS.md §Release Archive Standard. Archives
  still bundle `LICENSE` + `README.md` alongside the canonical binary.
- **darwin code-signature identifier** is now the canonical `sdate`
  (was `sdate-darwin-arm64`), set via `codesign -i` so it stays stable after
  the archived binary is renamed to its canonical name.

No change to the binary's behaviour — a packaging / build-config release.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **Darwin releases are now Developer ID signed and Apple-notarized.**
  `sdate-v1.1.3-darwin-{amd64,arm64}.zip` carry full Apple Developer
  ID Application signatures and notarization tickets from Apple. End
  users on macOS no longer need to bypass Gatekeeper with right-click
  → Open or `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` on first launch; local
  users who place `sdate` under Dropbox-synced (or any other
  FileProvider-managed) paths are no longer killed by macOS's
  ad-hoc + provenance distrust policy. Pipeline:
  `scripts/codesign-darwin.sh` + `scripts/notarize-darwin.sh`,
  driven by `make package`. Adopts the org-wide convention in
  `nlink-jp/.github` CONVENTIONS.md §Code Signing.

No behaviour change to the binary itself — feature-wise this is
identical to v1.1.2.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Unified Makefile: replaced macOS universal binary with separate `darwin/amd64` and `darwin/arm64` targets; standardized targets (`build`, `build-all`, `test`, `lint`, `check`, `package`, `clean`, `help`) and output layout (`dist/` flat directory, `.zip` archives).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-28

### Internal

- Updated Go module path to `github.com/nlink-jp/sdate` following repository transfer to nlink-jp organization.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added
- Change the start of the week to Sunday for `@w` snap operation.

### Fixed
- Fix a bug in parsing input strings where invalid inputs were not correctly identified.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added
- Initial release of `sdate`.
- Command-line tool for Splunk-like time manipulation.
- Support for relative time and snap operations.
- Flexible output formatting, including UNIX timestamp.
- Timezone handling for base time and output.
- Unit tests for core logic.

### Changed
- Improved `Makefile` to provide comprehensive build, test, and packaging targets.
- `make package` now builds and archives for Linux, Windows, and macOS (Universal Binary).
